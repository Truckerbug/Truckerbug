      <title>Hello</title>
  </head> <body> Hello! It's now 12:18, we're about to have lunch. I've just been playing around <br>
    for what looks like about 38 minutes. I think we're having mac and cheese, with <br>
    watermelon. Goodbye, again. Also now I have quite a few words saved in the <br>
    VScode dictionary.
PS. We aren't having mac and cheese, we're having something with tortillas.
ok now pizza?
